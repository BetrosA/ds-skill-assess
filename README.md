# ds-skill-assess
## Phase II technical assessment for data scientist candidates

This repository contains a short, notional example of SQL & R files designed to test your technical knowledge of basic data wrangling and version control.

### Ground Rules
You will have 1 hour to clone the repo, create your own branch, and push your branch back to the remote repo.

Please keep all work on your branch. Do not submit a pull request for main.

The errors are simple; do not over-think them.

Describe your approach in the ReadMe file's section below, as opposed to in-line comments.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. From `main`, create your own branch with `[your last name]/submission`
3. Correct errors in the SQL and R script as follows:
  * The SQL contains an error that will not generate correct output to be received by the R file. Please correct the SQL so that its output will match what the R file requires.
  * The R file contains one long series of steps that could more easily be separated into more descriptive functions that improve readability and maintainability. Please re-factor the R code to reflect cleaner, more maintainable code.
  * In the ReadMe file, modify the below section to explain your overall approach. Write as if speaking to other developers.

**NOTE**: When making corrections in the SQL or R file, please also consider formatting adjustments that more closely conform to generally accepted style guidance (e.g., indentation, vertical alignment, etc.).

4. Commit your edits and push your branch back to the remote repo within 1 hour

*GOOD LUCK!*
